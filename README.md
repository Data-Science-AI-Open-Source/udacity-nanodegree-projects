# Transfer Learning in PyTorch

The notebook contains the final project of **PyTorch Udacity Scholarship**.

The 102 Category Flower [Dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) from Visual Geometry Group, University of Oxford, is used.

The following steps are described:
* Preprocessing
* Transfer learning
* Saving and loading model checkpoint
* Inference and Validation

**NOTE:** *If the notebook doesn't render here on GitHub, try it on [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kHarshit/transfer-learning/blob/master/Transfer%20learning%20%28PyTorch%29.ipynb).*
