# Wrangle and Analyze Data

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, you will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. You will document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.

The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates), also known as [WeRateDogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeRateDogs). WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "[they're good dogs Brent](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/theyre-good-dogs-brent)." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

## Project Details

    * Assessing data
    * Cleaning data
* Storing, analyzing, and visualizing your wrangled data
* Reporting on 1) your data wrangling efforts and 2) your data analyses and visualizations
